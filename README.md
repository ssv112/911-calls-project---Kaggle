For this project, I have analyzed 911 call data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields:

lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)
Following Answers are Tried to Solve in this notebook:

What is the number of calls made each day of week and what was the reason of Call?
Insight - This can help police to fulfill the staffing requirement based on emergency skill in which they are trained.

What is the Monthwise distribution of overall 911 calls and how the call number is varying based on the Reason of call? Insight - This can help police to hire seasonal hiring of specialists which can help in the emergency situations

Which specific hour in a regular week, calls are prominent or hour wise distribution of calls with respect to day of week?

Insight - This info can provide evidence about the peak call hours when maximum staff is required

Which specific days in a regular Month, calls are prominent or day wise distribution of calls with respect to Month?
Insight - This info can provide evidence about the peak call days when calls are done most and hence staff is required accordingly
