For this project, I have analyzed 911 call data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields: <br/>

lat : String variable, Latitude <br/>
lng: String variable, Longitude <br/>
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call <br/>
zip: String variable, Zipcode <br/>

timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <br/>
twp: String variable, Township <br/>

e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1) <br/>
Following Answers are Tried to Solve in this notebook: <br/>

What is the number of calls made each day of week and what was the reason of Call? <br/>
Insight - This can help police to fulfill the staffing requirement based on emergency skill in which they are trained. <br/>

What is the Monthwise distribution of overall 911 calls and how the call number is varying based on the Reason of call? <br/> Insight - This can help police to hire seasonal hiring of specialists which can help in the emergency situations <br/>

Which specific hour in a regular week, calls are prominent or hour wise distribution of calls with respect to day of week? <br/>

Insight - This info can provide evidence about the peak call hours when maximum staff is required <br/>

Which specific days in a regular Month, calls are prominent or day wise distribution of calls with respect to Month? <br/>
Insight - This info can provide evidence about the peak call days when calls are done most and hence staff is required accordingly <br/>
